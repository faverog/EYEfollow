EYEfollow is a novel diagnostic device that combines an interactive user experience with cutting-edge eye tracking technology to deliver easy, fast, and accurate eye assessments.

EYEfollow is currently under development at the University of Windsor in a partnership between the Human Systems Lab (supervised by Dr. Bala Balasingam) and Dr. Moussa, a leading optometrist in the Windsor-Essex region.
